- Docker (optional, if you plan to use Docker).

### Installation

Install the necessary dependencies using **uv**:

```bash
uv install
```

### Usage

You can interact with Kurtis by either training the model or starting a chat session.

#### Train the Model

To train the model using the provided configuration:

```bash
uv run kurtis --train --config-module kurtis.config.default
```

#### Start a Chat Session

To start a conversation with the Kurtis chatbot:

```bash
uv run kurtis --chat --config-module kurtis.config.default
```

### Command-Line Options

You can view all available command-line options using the `--help` flag:

```bash
uv run kurtis --help
```

The output will display:
